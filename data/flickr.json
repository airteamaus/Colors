Well, this is me doing exactly that..\n\nTheres a few aurora forecast sites i follow closely. This particular day the forecast predicted just a little activity, so i didnt bother thinking about going out.\nI put my youngest son to sleep and as usual i fell asleep beside him. Woke up groggy and tired as hell..stumbled over to the computer and accidently checked the activity.\nWHAT?!?! The graphs were off the charts!! The forecast was changed to &quot;high levels&quot;... I grabbed my gear and drove like a madman towards one of my safe spots. I was a real danger in traffic this evening.\nI kept looking out the window constantly and the aurora really was going crazy. I know how these moments can fade quickly so it came to a point where i just couldnt risk losing this show. So i just pulled over, grabbed my camera, reached for the headlamp... oh come on...fucking forgot the headlamp!\nSo now i was forced to literally feel my way down to the edge of the sea, a couple of times i was pretty close to breaking both my legs and the equipment.\nI managed to get down in one piece. Then i had to compose in the dark. That was a challenge...\n\nI pulled out my papercard (i`ve replaced the cloth with a piece of paperboard), put it the filterholder so that it covered the sky. Started the exposure and after around 20 secs i removed the card, letting the sky expose for 5-6 seconds.\n\nAfter this i continued to my planned location. By the time i got there the activity had changed into something completely different. Instead of a vivid and intense lightshow, i now had the aurora all over the sky.

For those in a rush, it's enough to know the first attempt for North American viewers sits in the comments below.\n\nUpdate: just a quick one further to some questions/notes below, light painting is basically waving a torch (or other lightsource) around in front of the camera during a long exposure.  This leaves the trails of light you see above!  The deer were created in camera this way - not an edit!\n\nSince delighting myself with my first light painting www.flickr.com/photos/flatworldsedge/5022793280/, I've lined up a number of other light paintings I'd like to try.  A few weeks back I got the chance for a second session, but having invested in an overpowered Halfords torch (the torch I used first time round was borrowed) couldn't tame the light and just got flare.  A visit to a \u00a31 shop later and this is my third light painting session, the second shot I'm happy enough to post.\n\nI've had this in mind for a few weeks, but not seen the right place for it.  This evening I was out in the heavy fog shooting some Mars like images (to follow) when I found the fallen leaves had made the setting I was after.  So with Christmas closing in all too quickly, I gave it a go!  I took a few images to work out the reindeer (the first attempt ended up as a moose, posted in the comments for North American viewers), and then added the second reindeer at first take.  \n\nBy way of side note, the moose is around a 2/3 stop shorter exposure, and the colour isn't quite as cool as a result.\n\nNormally I shoot night time long exposures at ISO 100 to tame the noise on the 300D, but it was so dark in the forest that this needed a twelve minute exposure (729 seconds \u00a6 f/8) at ISO 200.  With each exposure something of a dice roll due to the reindeer, I felt the noise was an acceptable trade off to avoid 25 minute shots!  It's a very similar colour to the sodium cloud in www.flickr.com/photos/flatworldsedge/5182134181/, and the fog does a similar job with the street lighting.  The introduction of the forest and the lack of any moon, however, mean that shooting at the same settings (f/11 \u00a6 ISO100) last night's shot would have needed just shy of 50 minutes to get to the same place.\n\nKind of interesting, to me at least, sorry!\n\nFew other things.  It was raining quite hard by the end, and the mist stayed very dense, so I've amazed the torch didn't pick up droplets or flare more - it is very cheap (and dim) and I guess 12 minutes gives a lot of tolerance.  I used an A4 sheet of bubble wrap I keep as padding in the end of my bag as a makeshift camera cover; an innovation I can recommend.\n\nI just need a red light to add the festive nose next time round.  For now, I'm afraid you'll have to imagine it.  Hope you're all having a great weekend and you like the image.

After calling for them we went looking.  The dangerous thing about our yard is that it is unfenced and backs the intracoastal waterway and a big nature preserve where bobcats and other animals live. To make matters worse the tide was coming in which could leave them stranded down the beach with no way to get back. We went from house to house my older daughter frantically crying with worry. Several of our neighbors helped us look and a few took watch over the waterway from their yards. One neighbor who is an older gent said he knew we would get the dogs back and just to relax and not to worry yourself. Stay focused on what we are doing and it will work out. Easier said then done! \n\nWe did finally find them 3 hours later. They went about a half mile down the beach and could not find their way back. They were laying there thirsty and exhausted. I always think of the dogs as a feature of my kids childhood and  something we must put up with for their sake. But when we were searching for them I was sick with the idea of never seeing them again. In the end the old gent was right and it doesn't help to worry but better to keep a clear head and do what needs to be done.\n\nTaken for our daily challenge WEATHER, and REFLECTION (meditation) and PART of ME (my child)\n\nDon't use this image on websites, blogs or other media without explicit permission. \n\u00a9 All rights reserved\n\n\n\n", "title": "Clear your mind", "farm": 6, "url_m": "http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5290/5236322958_d292f00747.jpg", "longitude": 0.0, "server": "5290", "latitude": 0.0, "secret": "d292f00747", "owner": "47181226@N05", "uuid": "5b416676bab945e5baf39021a1f9dd8a"}}, {"pk": 5236364600, "model": "flickr.photo", "fields": {"imported": true, "description": "still trying to get autumn out of my blood\n\nno images in the comments. thanks.", "title": "", "farm": 6, "url_m": "http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5164/5236364600_84a9acccee.jpg", "longitude": 0.0, "server": "5164", "latitude": 0.0, "secret": "84a9acccee", "owner": "36309078@N00", "uuid": "2c977d0b9698407587c52b9254a316fa"}}, {"pk": 5236373743, "model": "flickr.photo", "fields": {"imported": true, "description": "Have a great week!", "title": "Just another little glass of water", "farm": 6, "url_m": "http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5049/5236373743_d746dfd27b.jpg", "longitude": 0.0, "server": "5049", "latitude": 0.0, "secret": "d746dfd27b", "owner": "43793670@N04", "uuid": "ddf8c3b80e9e430f9a8750b802b21f09"}}, {"pk": 5236499632, "model": "flickr.photo", "fields": {"imported": true, "description": "Day 122 - Straight to the north pole\n\nWell, you get three guesses what the wheater was like today... \n\nOur Daily Challenge for December 5th, 2010: Weather\n\n... this photo is brought to you by the Letter - L - press it and enjoy!\n\n50mm - f1.4 - 1/250 - ISO 100\n\nProject 365 - Twitter\n\n\nStrobist Info:\nSB-80dx (24mm - 1/128) bare as rimlight from the front with 6/4 CTO Gel, SB-80dx (24mm - 1/128) bare as mainlight from behind camera with 6/4 CTB Gel, camera and flashes tiggered via PocketWizard Plus II and optical trigger\n\nExplored - Monday, December 5, 2010 - #76", "title": "Day 122 - Straight to the north pole *Explore*", "farm": 6, "url_m": "http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5047/5236499632_32cb2d57f1.jpg", "longitude": 0.0, "server": "5047", "latitude": 0.0, "secret": "32cb2d57f1", "owner": "35827584@N05", "uuid": "360fadd026cf4c5ca932a07aabe5c49a"}}, {"pk": 5236573517, "model": "flickr.photo", "fields": {"imported": true, "description": "for Our Daily Challenge - black and white", "title": "Black and white pink zinnia", "farm": 6, "url_m": "http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5201/5236573517_bab69dfbee.jpg", "longitude": 175.265441, "server": "5201", "latitude": -37.796112, "secret": "bab69dfbee", "owner": "21277204@N03", "uuid": "4fde818a4a4f4e2caf19c353f2036069"}}, {"pk": 5236574205, "model": "flickr.photo", "fields": {"imported": true, "description": "Kali for Yellowbirdd Vintage, again.

Over several days in July, I was again fortunate to witness this extraordinary behavior. Even though I cruise with my own boat, finding a groups of whales feeding can be difficult and time consuming. However, once I have located them I drift nearby for hours hoping that they will occasionally come close enough to be photographed. During their attack the whales emit a high-pitched song to scare the fish and coordinate their timing. (Check out my YouTube video to hear what it sounds like.) To create a picture like this, my reflexes have to be lightning fast. It certainly helps if my camera is already pointed in the right direction when they break the surface. The momentary drama of water exploding into the air and fish jumping out of the whale's wide-open mouths to avoid being swallowed is beyond my wildest dreams.

It is the second largest man-made reservoir in the United States behind Lake Mead, storing 24,322,000 acre feet (30 km\u00b3) of water when full. Lake Powell was created by the flooding of Glen Canyon by the controversial Glen Canyon Dam, which also led to the creation of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, a popular summer destination. The reservoir is named for explorer John Wesley Powell, a one-armed American Civil War  veteran who explored the river via three wooden boats in 1869. In 1972, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area was established. It is public land managed by the National Park Service, and available to the public for recreational purposes. It lies in parts of Garfield, Kane, and San Juan counties in southern Utah, and Coconino County in northern Arizona.\n\nLake Powell is a storage facility for the Upper Basin states of the Colorado River Compact (Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and New Mexico). The Compact specifies that the Upper Basin states are to provide a minimum annual flow of 8.23 million acre feet (10 km\u00b3) to the Lower Basin states (Arizona, Nevada, and California).\n\nFrom  Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ", "title": "Just A Desert Sunrise", "farm": 6, "url_m": "http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5084/5241080750_1303ed6015.jpg", "longitude": -111.490646, "server": "5084", "latitude": 36.99472, "secret": "1303ed6015", "owner": "53074617@N00", "uuid": "c0c793700d7e4916a4849f24df8317ff"}}, {"pk": 5241093179, "model": "flickr.photo", "fields": {"imported": true, "description": "The warm sun splashing on the trestle bridge over the Fox River looks warm and inviting but belies the fact that it was about 1\u00b0 (with wind chills below 0) when I took this right after sunrise!

Fair warning proffered.\n\nDestination &quot;The Wave&quot;.  I'd been trying to get permits to go here for the better part of a year, and when the morning finally arrived, Steve Turner and I decided we wanted to hit the trail right at first light.  My &quot;Moons over myHammy&quot; from Denny's took a little longer than normal to process, so we were not the first people on the trail.  There were some navigational failures by the couple in front of us, however, so we WERE the first people into the fabled Wave.  What a spot.  You could shoot 10 memory cards full here and still have some creative juice flowing, and we had it all to ourselves!  I got 6 shots before it happened.  Six.  Shots.  Not six cards full.  Six frames.  I had a massive failure of my tripod ballhead.\n\nIt started several days before on the first leg of my week-long shooting journey.  When I had arrived in Cali to hate on Jim Patterson, Kendra, Jave, Diego, and Josh Cripps, I noticed that the friction of my ballhead wouldn't really release.  I'd had this problem before, and I knew that with enough manipulating, it would eventually free up.  Jim was most helpful in suggesting that I should just go home.  It was stiff enough that I considered buying a new one in Vegas the next day before I headed out on the rest of my trip, but finally decided that I could make due.  \n\nIt continued like this for days, in and out of some rugged country.  My ballhead and I had reached a sort of grudging mutual respect.  I realized that it was annoyed with me, but if I applied enough brute force, it would bend to my will.  The night before the Wave Day, however, were the most brutal conditions I've ever shot in.  50+mph winds whipping White Pocket sand up, down, through, and between every single inch of gear and photographer.  I left my camera in the bag, save for one shot, but my poor tripod had nowhere to hide and was exposed to the whole thing.  \n\nFlash forward back to The Wave, and I can hear sand grinding in my tripod legs, head, pivots.... everywhere.  No matter, I think, she'll get a good cleaning as soon as I finish here, as it was back to the airport that evening to head to work.  My ballhead had other ideas.  The friction lock.... er.... locked.  Like wouldn't budge.  No way, no how, no sir.  You simply could not twist it.  \n\nNo problem you say, the ballhead was really stiff anyway, right?  Wrong.  The conspiracy was complete.  Simultaneously with the friction lock failing, the ballhead decided to go fully loose.  It was just flopping in the breeze.  No amount of Viagra was going to get this puppy upright.  He was just plain spent.  \n\nSteve and I tried everything.  I had sticks, plastic, Famous Amos (which Steve ALWAYS brings for me) stuck in there, trying to wedge it upright to no avail.  I figured if I could just get it to stay flat, I could adjust my tripod legs enough to be able to shoot, albeit with less than creative angles.  Nothing was helping.  I had been waiting a year to be here, and I was going to have to hand-hold my shots.  I suck WITH a tripod, imagine how bad things are going to be without one.  Oh, and I don't have grads, so I NEED to blend images 90 percent of the time. \n\nIf you haven't been paying attention, start now, because here is where things get good.  Steve, who is kind enough to stop and consider my plight, suggests that we have been going about this all wrong.  What we need is something to wrap around the neck enough to immobilize the tripod head.  I wouldn't be able to move it, but perhaps it would support the weight of the camera.  But what to use?  Its a 6 mile round trip to the car, and 3 hours round trip from there back to Page.  I just wouldn't have time.  That's when it happened.\n\nSteve: &quot;WAIT!  I can use a diaper!&quot;.\n\nMe:  &quot;A what?&quot;\n\nSteve:  &quot;Yeah, I think my diaper will work!&quot;.  \n\n(Produces a diaper).  \n\nNow, a lot of questions were going through my mind.  \n\n1)  Why does Steve have a diaper?  I mean, he's not THAT old.\n\n2)  Far be it from me to cast stones, as I've had my share of adult potty accidents in my life, but what if he NEEDS this diaper.  Do I really want to deprive him of its use just for a few shots?  I DO have to ride back with him in the car, after all.  \n\nFinally, my desperation cast care to the wind, and we wrapped the crap out of that diaper around the neck of my tripod (pardon the pun).  Lo and behold... it worked.  Sort of.  I just needed to NOT TOUCH anything, and it would stay reasonably stable.  \n\nNot wanting to push my luck, we set off to find the shots that we REALLY wanted.  I didn't know how many images that diaper would be good for, so I didn't want to put any more strain on it than necessary.  So we found this spot and camped on it.... for 6 hours.  When the light finally came, it was worth it.  SOOO worth it.  I have never been so thankful for Steve and whatever intestinal issues he has in my life.  \n\nCredit for this comp goes to Alex Mody, who was the first person I had seen who shot this place outside of the standard comp, which I also indulged in and might share some day.  \n\nwww.milesmorganphotography.com\n\n\n\nP.S.  Steve's diaper was one of the old cloth kinds, and I'm pretty sure he uses it to clean his lenses because its soft.  It pains me to reveal this, as it was much more fun when I thought of it as a Depends situation, but the guy DID keep me shooting, so I owe him at least that much.

Avery and I started sketching a couple of weeks ago, right when the leaves started falling off the trees here in North Carolina. We really wanted to incorporate the feeling of Fall and the changing of the seasons into an image. We came up with the plan to fill a room with leaves and have the windows open, blowing the leaves around, as well as letting in a large amount of light. From our sketching we knew we wanted to the model facing the window, but I also wanted her face to be visible to make the shot a little more personal, and so the viewer could identify with a face in the midst of a ton of leaves. Also I knew we were going to need a rim light acting as a secondary key in the image so we wouldn\u2019t have a completely dark face on the model. I wanted decent fill with the lights, but still a strong feeling of directionality.\n\n\n\nFor more behind the Scenes and some video from the shoot - \ncheck out Avery and My Blog www.aaronandavery.com\n\n\nI Teach Photoshop online to people all over the world, if you like my work, you will love the class.

Una delicia, a esto unes toda la naturaleza que tienes a mano y la gastronomia Castellana.... \n\nLa Universidad de Santa Catalina. El Burgo de Osma (Soria, Espa\u00f1a) es de planta cuadrada y est\u00e1 estructurada mediante un gran patio con columnas. Este patio es \nrenacentista y dispone de dos plantas conectadas por una monumental escalinata. La grandiosa fachada est\u00e1 realizada en estilo plateresco. Dispone de dos grandes columnas que est\u00e1n decoradas con grutescos y figuras en relieve en la parte inferior mientras que aparecen acanaladas en su parte superior. Sobre el dintel que enmarca la puerta de acceso al interior se encuentra el nicho entre columnas que cobija la imagen de Santa Catalina, el escudo imperial y los escudos del obispo Acosta. Corona este segundo cuerpo un front\u00f3n triangular. El escudo superior que rompe la cornisa es de \u00e9poca posterior. Las obras concluyeron en el a\u00f1o 1549, aunque posteriormente se realizaron varias reformas a cargo de Bernasconi, ya en el siglo XVIII. Lleg\u00f3 a acoger las facultades de Teolog\u00eda, Filosof\u00eda, Derecho y Medicina. Los estudios se suprimieron entre 1770 y 1778. Con motivo de la guerra de la Independencia se clausur\u00f3 de nuevo aunque volvi\u00f3 a ejercer desde 1811 hasta su cierre definitivo en el a\u00f1o 1841.

She's a rescue--picked up on the streets of a Northwestern city, bedraggled and sick and more than a little skinny a few Januaries ago.  She went to the pound where she got kennel cough, and then was rescued and nursed back to health by breed rescue (Australian Shepherd [ARPH--Aussie Rescue &amp; Placement Helpline 1-877-ARPH-779]).  She spent several months in rescue and was adopted out once and returned, because the people thought she was aggressive because she barked at bicycles.  Not aggressive, just herding instinct.  And perhaps a little time on the streets getting away with chasing things that moved.  So finally Misty came to us, and it's been a long and fun journey (almost three years now--she's our &quot;Earth Day Girl&quot;).  I can't even begin to tell you how fun she is.    She loves everyone, has tons of personality, and is definitely one of the ruff and tumble fav's at our local dog club.  Aussies aren't for everyone though, they're a commitment to a high-energy instinct driven velcro dog.  Velcro--meaning they hang close to your side once they're bonded.  \n\nInterested in Rescue?  \nCalifornia:  www.norcalaussierescue.org/\nThe Northwest:  www.aussierescuenw.org/\n", "title": "Misty, chasing waves", "farm": 6, "url_m": "http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5047/5244391966_2f4b5e464b.jpg", "longitude": 0.0, "server": "5047", "latitude": 0.0, "secret": "2f4b5e464b", "owner": "73296523@N00", "uuid": "69248108abf246f6a09f5b0181561966"}}, {"pk": 5244399361, "model": "flickr.photo", "fields": {"imported": true, "description": "", "title": "Aim .....

(possibly not the last, sorry, I will start apologising for them)\n\nSo I think I\u2019ve said before in \u2018Flat\u2019 that the thing about Crosby beach is that \u2018s totally flat, well as you saw from the slope in the pano, it does have a natural run away slope.. but still no rocky features that would add interest and catch swirling water nicely.... However there are two places that I know fairly smallish rocks collect... I don\u2019t know if these are debris from the foundations of pipes and such like or what, there is one collection between Crosby and Blundelsands, and another pile here at the end of the pipe that has featured in many of the pictures recently.\n\nYou can see a mile marker, in view and also, when seen on the full size image, Perch Rock light house and fort over on the Wirral, with the hills of Wales beyond, I don\u2019t expect any of that to be appreciated at this scale though.\n\nBe warned if you want to attempt shots here or beyond, check tide times, it does come in very quickly, if you see it coming, you would not reach shore without swimming... also wear very tight fitting boots, I near lost mine here, so I will suggest that I\u2019ve risked life and limb to show this picture :)\n\nIncidentally the darkness is as the camera saw, there is no vignette, although added contrast accentuates the effect, the light post sun down has extreme contrast and and is highly polarised, with little diffused ambient light, very wide angle lenses with these filters often 'suffer' from this as direction of the polarised light coming from different parts of the sky reach the camera. I do have other pictures featuring this effect which I may share, if you are really interested let me know.\n\n\n\nHave a great day!\n\n\nComments, faves and constructive crit., always very welcome, graphics not preferred\n\nPress L to view in Lightbox", "title": "Stones, Crosby beach", "farm": 6, "url_m": "http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5288/5246245428_13228eb494.jpg", "longitude": -3.056602, "server": "5288", "latitude": 53.486513, "secret": "13228eb494", "owner": "46119400@N02", "uuid": "133d55366ecb46e493f5c5213007dfc3"}}, {"pk": 5246279606, "model": "flickr.photo", "fields": {"imported": true, "description": "follow my tumblr - eric5dmark2.tumblr.com/", "title": "storm is coming", "farm": 6, "url_m": "http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5128/5246279606_8cf2d60a42.jpg", "longitude": -116.016698, "server": "5128", "latitude": 33.98584, "secret": "8cf2d60a42", "owner": "47442337@N08", "uuid": "076e8097538743f58a3d54049680d957"}}, {"pk": 5246309119, "model": "flickr.photo", "fields": {"imported": true, "description": "Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany.

this contrasting photo to express some of my inner child, somewhat inspired by Toy Story and many other things :) Which btw, if you have not seen Toy Story 3, you should, it\u2019s a tear jerker!  \n\nShoot Details:\nWell this is the longest photo shoot I have done yet!  Haha, it took me like 12 hours in total, including staying up until 4am and then shooting the whole next day and being late to class, to cut out those cardboard shapes, paint them, hang them all right for the frame, and then try a couple outfits and posing!  This was my favourite in the end, so I hope you like it!  I lit it with 4 light sources: some window light to fill the galaxy shapes to the camera left and back, a strobe with umbrella camera left on me, a low power strobe filling the back of my head and shoulders camera right and a tungsten lamp camera right to fill those close up galaxy shapes.  It was really fun to do!  I know I\u2019ve said it before and havn\u2019t yet but on my Facebook Page I will do some lighting demos and show you set ups occasionally.  Once break is here I should have time to make a few!

Seven gave me free reign with the art direction, and I chose to do this simply because it involved more than just putting on a costume. I have always been intrigued by the look of Steampunk culture and its quirkiness, I therefore decided to take on the task of making or customizing each prop used for this shoot. I believe that this did add alot more value to the shoot and making a picture. It took me a few days, a big mess at home, numerous trips to the hardware store, some discussions with the wardrobe stylist to get the right costumes and alot of fun to produce the props, which I think were very essential to this shoot. Aside from that, the amazing location just did the rest.\n\nBase for the props were:\n1. Welders helmet - Mask\n2. Welders goggles - Goggles\n3. Construction mask - Half face gas mask\n4.

I love photography, doodling, my friends, my internet friends, the internet, books, food and most of all: GOD. I'm awkward and shy when it comes to socializing so in school I pretty much have few friends but that's fine for me, unless they ALL become fake. I like listening to random music artists. I always like sleeping and eating. But I hate when my tummy gets big everytime I eat A LOT. I really miss summer. I don't even care if I'm bored during summer. All I want is a friggin VACATION. I like trying out new candies I never heard before. And same with desserts. When it comes to clothing and stuff, I have my own style. For me, all that matters is that I'm comfortable with what I'm wearing. I'm not cool or anything. I'm a nerd by the way. I REALLY AM. And It's not just because I wear glasses. Maybe because I love reading so much and I don't know. And I participate at school stuff. I love looking for inspirations around the internet. I also like film pictures, but I wish I could take film pictures.

I then noticed when the books are piled up on one another it makes up a tree- and without these beautiful pieces of nature we wouldn't have books. Wishing you all a crafty Christmas and picking up a good book and reading it this holiday season!  \n", "title": "Keeping Christmas Real Simple", "farm": 6, "url_m": "http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5003/5251474086_1a017d5289.jpg", "longitude": 0.0, "server": "5003", "latitude": 0.0, "secret": "1a017d5289", "owner": "46483003@N05", "uuid": "9b2491f9b6c24af58fc948423042fb01"}}, {"pk": 5251476359, "model": "flickr.photo", "fields": {"imported": true, "description": "www.jessicamilan.es/", "title": "", "farm": 6, "url_m": "http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5002/5251476359_17f585e504.jpg", "longitude": 0.0, "server": "5002", "latitude": 0.0, "secret": "17f585e504", "owner": "42965656@N07", "uuid": "20f4773b0c094f69846bbdae9a681742"}}, {"pk": 5251513864, "model": "flickr.photo", "fields": {"imported": true, "description": "Cliche?

Rainier this year and must say that I feel truly blessed to have had so many wonderful adventures on that mountain in the past five months.  My time there is never long enough but I assure you that during each moment I am uttering many a thank you.  And a big thank you to VisitRainier for having me up again and to the National Park Inn at Longmire for their most excellent hospitality and food.  And to the wonderful people I met during my stay.  Great conversations, crackling fires, Santa train ride, snowshoeing and playing in the snow.  The weather wasn't terribly cooperative but that didn't seem to matter to all of the people who drove up to the mountain to enjoy the snow, they just kept coming.  Things were a little sketchy when I left with warm weather, snow melt and a lot of rain, causing the Nisqually River to rise quite a bit - I'm keeping everyone up there, in Ashford and surrounding communities, in my thoughts and hope that it passes soon.\n\nNow, to the fox.  I've done a lot of complaining that every red fox I'd seen was black and gray so this was my first red beauty.

Appearing first only in 1934-1935, the lake grew from 7.9 km\u00b2 in 1975 to at least 18 km\u00b2 today because of heavy melting of the Icelandic glaciers.\n\nWhen it is cloudy and the water is calmed, the image of the icebergs are mirrored on the lake's surface. The possibilities for photography thanks to symmetries are infinite with this conditions. There are small different water currents, which draw lines on that surface, visible like scratches on the mirror. \n\nJokulsarlon, Iceland, 2010.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEl lago Jokulsarlon es, probablemente, el m\u00e1s famoso y grande de todos los lagos glaciares\nde Islandia. Creado artificialmente en 1934-1935, el lago ha aumentado en un \u00e1rea de 7,9 km \u00b2 en 1975 a 18 km \u00b2 hoy d\u00eda, debido al deshielo producido por el calentamiento global.\n\nCuando est\u00e1 nublado y las aguas tranquilas, la imagen de los icebergs se refleja en la  superficie del lago. Es entonces cuando las posibilidades para hacer buenas fotograf\u00edas se disparan gracias a las simetr\u00edas. \nAdem\u00e1s, hay peque\u00f1as corrientes de agua a distintas velocidades, que dibujan l\u00edneas en la superficie, visibles como ara\u00f1azos en &quot;el espejo&quot;. \n\nJokulsarlon, Islandia, 2010.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nMore at pakdock.com\n\n\nPAk DocK\u00a9 \n\nPAk DocK in facebook\nPAk DocK in twitter", "title": "Arrow at Jokulsarlon", "farm": 6, "url_m": "http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5005/5257698168_3364c10e04.jpg", "longitude": -16.182239, "server": "5005", "latitude": 64.048622, "secret": "3364c10e04", "owner": "36662563@N00", "uuid": "b94e62f42a7f4651924f9c547dbdcc35"}}, {"pk": 5257698716, "model": "flickr.photo", "fields": {"imported": true, "description": "Da vedere in:\nView On Black", "title": "\"Oh... it moves!!\" ...it's almost time.", "farm": 6, "url_m": "http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5087/5257698716_715e14c59a.jpg", "longitude": 9.127578, "server": "5087", "latitude": 45.459287, "secret": "715e14c59a", "owner": "30078572@N02", "uuid": "da62854ea0a145df864bf007019bfd3f"}}, {"pk": 5257717652, "model": "flickr.photo", "fields": {"imported": true, "description": "Then she whispered in his ear\u2026.The Sound Of White - Missy Higgins\n\nHave a nice day!", "title": "Day 118/365: Then She Whispered In His Ear", "farm": 6, "url_m": "http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5088/5257717652_e7cd3ab8c0.jpg", "longitude": 0.0, "server": "5088", "latitude": 0.0, "secret": "e7cd3ab8c0", "owner": "46737783@N05", "uuid": "672972fc8b384f71a4202157881fca40"}}, {"pk": 5257727626, "model": "flickr.photo", "fields": {"imported": true, "description": "It seems I got lucky with the clouds, the sky cleared at just the right place and time...\n\nA panorama with vertical shots from a wide angle, with 5 different exposures blended, and a single shot for the sky above the Big Ben, through a 10x ND, 2min shutter time.", "title": "Radiant London", "farm": 6, "url_m": "http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5170/5257727626_78ca807843.jpg", "longitude": 0.0, "server": "5170", "latitude": 0.0, "secret": "78ca807843", "owner": "53414773@N00", "uuid": "a5f9067e7c9b490fa23a814bd021dc26"}}, {"pk": 5257731633, "model": "flickr.photo", "fields": {"imported": true, "description": "The Bauhaus Building by Walter Gropius\nBuilt 1925\u20131926\n\nThe Bauhaus originated in Weimar in 1919 as a new type of design school.

That Dessau, an aspiring industrial city in central Germany, was chosen by the Bauhaus Masters over Frankfurt am Main, for example, depended in part on the fact that it could offer the Bauhaus a new school building. Walter Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus in 1919 and its director until 1928, designed the building on behalf of the city of Dessau and in cooperation with Carl Fieger, Ernst Neufert and others in his private architectural practice \u2013 the Bauhaus did not have its own department of architecture until 1927.

Todav\u00eda quedaban secuelas de la nevada del jueves, era mi \u00faltima tarde en el Burgo de Osma y decid\u00ed ir de paseo con la c\u00e1mara, mi hija y mis cu\u00f1ados. El cielo ten\u00eda una pinta como nunca... as\u00ed que me fui en busca del Castillo de Osma. Mi sorpresa fue, que a esa hora y con el fri\u00f3 que hacia, la gente sal\u00eda a pasear como si nada. Una de mis paradas pude tomar una toma como esta. No fue f\u00e1cil, porque el chorreo de gente era constante. La verdad es que fue una tarde provechosa, de cual ir\u00e9 subiendo m\u00e1s fotos en tiempos venideros.\n\nCastillo de Osma: El castillo de Osma se alza sobre un monte a las afueras de las localidades de El Burgo de Osma y Osma, provincia de Soria. El castillo se asienta sobre un cerro entre los r\u00edos Ucero y Avi\u00f3n, pr\u00f3ximo a la c\u00e9lebre ciudad romana de Uxama.\nEl castillo de Osma fue construido entre los siglos X y XI, y modificado entre los siglos XIV y XV.\nLa fortaleza de Osma ten\u00eda tres recintos amurallados de forma irregular, adapt\u00e1ndose al cerro donde se asentaban.\nEn el primer recinto, o recinto interior, destacan sus a\u00fan altos muros y la puerta de acceso, que pudo tener un arco de herradura similar al del castillo de Gormaz. En los extremos del lado este de este recinto se disponen dos torres, una la del Homenaje, y de la otra de donde parte el segundo recinto.\nDel segundo recinto, que rodeaba al primero, apenas quedan restos, lo mismo que del tercero, siendo el resto m\u00e1s destacado de \u00e9ste \u00faltimo la torre del Agua, situada en el extremo norte. La torre del Agua se encuentra en la base del cerro, junto la r\u00edo Ucero, y proteg\u00eda tanto el acceso al puente como la recogida de agua.\nLa fortaleza se encontraba rodeada de atalayas situadas a mayor cota que \u00e9l, como las de Uxama, Valdenarro y Lomero, con las que se comunicaba visualmente.\n\n\nEsta foto se la quiero dedicar a mi cu\u00f1ado fa\u00e9, que estuvo conmigo en todo momento aguantando la rasca que hac\u00eda.

The original colour version is in the comments.  The colour isn't at all bad, though I though the grass was a little uninspiring.  The black and white felt better suited to the subject matter too.\n\nJust upfront I'd add a note to the effect that in so far as this is a memorial to the victims of conflict, the crosses for the graves are simply there as the image that was in my mind and a shape that would easily repeat into the distance.  It's not meant to be religious at all, just a quickly understood icon for a western audience, I suppose.\n\nOn the technical side it's a 414 second exposure - enough time to make all 24 crosses, the saluting soldier and the distant flare.  As regards the flare, I'm glad it worked - just a result of aiming the torch (aka flashlight) at the lens from 200m distance.  I felt the image needed an anchor at the end of the field of crosses, and the effect worked quite well I feel.\n\nMeanwhile, I wanted to give the impression of angled light from that point through the crosses to the soldier, so attempted to tilt the torch's face on the left side of his body to give the impression of shadow there.  This gave a few bends to lines that might have better been straight (e.g. his helmet's left rim), but was, by and large successful, so it's a technique I'll try again.\n\nAs for the torch itself, this is a new one.  I mentioned in www.flickr.com/photos/flatworldsedge/5233410987/ I felt my cheap \u00a31 torch was better than an expensive on due to lack of flare.  It simply isn't bright enough over 10-15' though.  So I invested in a ridiculously powerful torch with a much tighter beam.  You can see above there's quite a bit of flare, but it produces better lines I think.  It's also an aluminum finish, so you can trace it across your limbs without it catching - the rubber grip torch is too sticky to trace properly against the body.\n\nNot sure if that's interesting, but I get quite a few questions about this sort of thing at the moment, so thought I'd note it here.  I've also put a trial run from another location in the comments - probably a stronger scene, but it needed the soldier figure to tie it together, I think, and that only occured to me later.\n\nHope everyone is having a great start to the week.", "title": "Some Corner Of A Field (Black and White Light Painting)", "farm": 6, "url_m": "http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5242/5257912373_7bf3881f58.jpg", "longitude": -0.484943, "server": "5242", "latitude": 51.632935, "secret": "7bf3881f58", "owner": "53196512@N07", "uuid": "b36051490d06431bbc1d3a8f7b09a66c"}}, {"pk": 5257916842, "model": "flickr.photo", "fields": {"imported": true, "description": "I bought this adorable matchbox village from the super fantastic Machel.

Despu\u00e9s de varios intentos de desecaci\u00f3n, desapareci\u00f3 finalmente como humedal en 1968 para abrir nuevas tierras de cultivo. Sin embargo, a partir del a\u00f1o 1990 existe un exitoso proyecto de recuperaci\u00f3n del humedal llevado a cabo por la Fundaci\u00f3n Global Nature y diversas administraciones, habi\u00e9ndose restituido unas 400 hect\u00e1reas.\nEs una laguna esteparia, con un r\u00e9gimen hidrol\u00f3gico anual controlado de forma artificial, debido a que el aporte de precipitaciones es m\u00ednimo y claramente insuficiente. Es una laguna de profundidad somera, con unos 40 cm de media, que se mantiene con agua desde el oto\u00f1o hasta que se seca durante el verano. El agua que se introduce en las cubetas lagunares procede en su mayor parte del Canal de Castilla.\nAcoge important\u00edsimos contingentes de aves acu\u00e1ticas, y existe en la actualidad un inventario con 222 especies de aves, lo que supone el 41 % de todas especies presentes en Espa\u00f1a, incluidas las islas.\nEs zona de importancia internacional para el \u00e1nsar com\u00fan (Anser anser) con concentraciones m\u00e1ximas de hasta 10.000 individuos.

I captured it on film on a mountain trip between Christmas and New Years Eve in 1997 (with the Nikon FE-2). I have already posted a BW version earlier and I think I like that version even better. But, I figured this color version could be a nice end of the year &quot;post card&quot; photo for 2010. The photo itself is not so spectacular but the scene is of course very special with the light breaking through the fog behind the snowed down trees.\n\nIt has been a very busy year for me and I have not posted many photos on Flickr. I hope to improve this in 2011. Most of my time at Flick I devote as one of the admins of the group PPro - thoughtful meeting place to share images, get honest critique, and build a knowledge. Another reason for the lack of photos in 2010 has also been that my key projects in 2010 have been of a very personal nature. I have turned to photographing people (trying to lift the family photo to a higher level). It has been a very rewarding experience and I have been shooting most of my stuff with the 50mm f/1.4 and the 35mm f/1.8. Lately I have been enjoying the superb ISO performance of the new D7000 body and shooting people and places in very low light conditions. I have also been working on and completed two family book projects.\n\nI thank you all for your interest in my photography. In spite of my 2010 absence as an active Flickr poster and commenter I hope we can stay in touch also in 2011.

It is located in southwest Bolivia, near the crest of the Andes, and is elevated 3,656 meters (11,995 ft) above the sea level. The Salar is covered by a few meters of salt crust, which has an extraordinary flatness with the average altitude variations within one meter over the entire area. (So flat that it is used to calibrate Earth observation satelittes' altimeters!) It\u2019s one of the biggest salt reserve, with 10 billion tons. Only 25,000 tons are extracted every year. (Even the bricks of the constructions you can see are made out of salt)\n\nThe Salar is virtually devoid of any wild life and vegetation. The latter is dominated by giant cacti. They grow at a rate of about 1 centimeter (0.39 in) per year to a length of about 12 meters (39 ft) (We're talking about 1,200 years old cacti!). Also present are quinoa plants and quenua bushes. Every November, Salar de Uyuni is the breeding grounds for pink South American flamingos. Andean fox (culpeo) is a representative animal, and the &quot;islands&quot; of Salar (in particular the Incahuasi island, see a picture of it, and another one), hosts a colony of rabbit-like viscachas.\n\nA total of 200 species adapted to the extreme life conditions and a lot of them are endangered.\nThe small exploitation of the crust (salt reserve) isn't a problem, but it covers a pool of brine, which is exceptionally rich in lithium: 50 to 70% of the world's reserves, which has yet to be extracted and represent a great interest for several international companies. The industrial extraction of Lithium, if it happens,  might change theses landscapes for ever, and endanger the local species even more.\n\nThis place is an enormous ecological challenge.\n\n[FR] Titre : &quot;Passe moi le sel&quot;. Le Salar de Uyuni est le plus grand d\u00e9sert de sel au monde, avec une surface de 10 582 km\u00b2. Il se situe dans le Sud-Ouest de la Bolivie, non loin de la cordill\u00e8re des Andes et \u00e0 une altitude de 3 656 m\u00e8tres. Le Salar est l\u2019une des plus grosses r\u00e9serves de sel au monde, avec 10 milliards de tonnes. Seulement 25,000 tonnes sont extraites par an. M\u00eame les briques des constructions que vous pouvez voir sont faites en sel. La surface est couverte par une croute de sel solide, \u00e9paisse de quelques m\u00e8tres, et qui poss\u00e8de une plan\u00e9it\u00e9 presque parfaite : la variation d\u2019altitude sur toute la surface est inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 un m\u00e8tre. Une surface si plate qu\u2019elle est utilis\u00e9e pour la calibration des satellites d\u2019observation terrestre. Cette immensit\u00e9 de sel presque vide n\u2019est gu\u00e8re accueillante. Le jour, le soleil cogne. La nuit, il y fait un froid glacial.\n\nCurieusement, on y trouve de la vie. C\u00f4t\u00e9 flore, la surface des \u00eelots rocheux (Notamment l\u2019\u00eele Incahuasi, dont voici une photo, et une autre.) est domin\u00e9e par une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de cactus g\u00e9ants. Ils poussent \u00e0 une vitesse d\u2019un centim\u00e8tre par an et mesurent en moyenne jusqu\u2019\u00e0 12 m\u00e8tres, ce qui correspond \u00e0 un \u00e2ge incroyable de 1 200 ans ! Parmi eux, quelques buissons et plantes de quinoa. C\u00f4t\u00e9 faune, chaque mois de novembre le Salar de Uyuni devient le lieu de reproduction des flamands roses d\u2019Am\u00e9rique du Sud. On y trouve \u00e9galement le renard des Andes ainsi que les viscachas, vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de lapin \u00e0 la queue longue que l\u2019on ne trouve nulle part ailleurs qu\u2019en Am\u00e9rique du Sud.\n\nUn total de 200 esp\u00e8ces se sont adapt\u00e9es \u00e0 ces conditions de vie extr\u00eames, et beaucoup d\u2019entre elles sont en danger.

Since she wanted to see pines, I decided to go to the most nearby. We stop close to this building, not for so many years the people were living there (Nowadays only it is used to protect the cattle in the night). Here we call them parideras, in other places they are called stables, farmhouses, etc...\n\n Parideras: The paridera is a traditional present construction in the south of Soria and Aragon, and north of Guadalajara. Your use is destined to the guard of the sheep, so much to protect it from wild animals as to guard it in those moments in which it is not led to grazing. They are constructed by walls of dry stone, roof to two waters, and roof by girders of black poplar. They consist of a corral that it precedes at the principal entry, endowed with a tinado or shed, as well as of an exterior enclosure that one communicates with the corral for an argoll\u00f3n, opening that allows the step of the lambs. In the interior they have in addition a closed, called space pajera, destined to store straw and grain preventing the animals from consuming it.\n\nTextures by : pareeerica.
